Deployed convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset using Keras. 
Used one-hot vectors for categorical labels, Added layers to a Keras model, Loaded pre-trained weights.
Accomplished successful predictions by optimizing the Keras model via Stochaistic Gradient Descent algorithm.
